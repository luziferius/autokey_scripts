# autokey_scripts
This repository holds some of my Python scripts for usage with autokey.
See https://github.com/autokey/autokey

# NumpadIME
This set of scripts lets you type texts using the keyboard number pad,
by emulating an old-style cellphone keyboard (without T9 functionality).
Use it if you go for maximum space saving and only connect a USB keypad.

This was requested in the https://gitter.im/autokey/autokey chat around May 15th, 2018.
