# A simple IME for usage with the keyboard number pad.
# It allows to type texts using only the keyboard number pad in a style commonly found on older cell phones.

# This script contains the core logic. It should not executed directly,
# but instead executed on key press by the other NumpadIME_key_* scripts alongside this script.
